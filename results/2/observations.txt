Observations
Prey numbers overall increase, however initially drop significantly
Predator numbers overall increase much more than prey, however initially drop slightly
Predator numbers do not reach the same levels as in the previous Simulation

Predators' combat level increases overall, more than in the last experiment. However, it initially drop slightly
Prey's combat level increases significantly overall
Predator combat levels increase less than prey's


Alterations
Increase the number of generations to 30, to see if any patterns emerge
Increase the minimum minimum energy level needed to survive for the predators to 5
Increase the maximum minimum energy level needed to survive for the predators to 10
Increase minimum energy starting level of a predator to 5
Decrease maximum energy starting level of a predator to 15
