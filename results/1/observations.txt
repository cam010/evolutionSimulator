Observations
- Prey count dips significantly before increasing again
- Predator count is seemingly unaffected by spontaneous death and death by lack of energy, as they outbreed it
- Predators' combat level increases slightly overall, but varies between generations
- Prey's combat level increases significantly overall, despite decreasing in the first generation

Alterations
- Use a larger minimum sporadic death chance for predators, use 10
- Increase the amount of energy taken from predators per turn to 4
- Increase the amount of energy given to prey per turn to 4
