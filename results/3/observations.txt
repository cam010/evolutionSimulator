Observations
This took far too long to complete, due to the large net growth of prey and predator counts
The amount of prey and predators remained similar from generation 4+, before this there were almost double
the amount of predators compared to prey
The amount of predators and prey increased rapidly, seemingly unaffected by energy loss

Alterations
Reduce generations to 10
Decrease the amount of energy absorbed from consumption of prey to 10%
After the population reaches 100_000, decrease the amount of energy that a prey gets by half
