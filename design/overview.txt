There are 2 sets of organisms, predators and prey
Each organism consists of a genome which dictates their characteristics
The characteristics of the prey are:
    - Reproduction chance
    - Offspring amount
    - Chance of spontaneous death
    - Defence level
    - Starting energy level
    - Minimum energy level to survive

The characteristics of the predators are:
    - Attack level
    - Minimum energy level to survive
    - Reproduction chance
    - Offspring amount
    - Chance of spontaneous death
    - Starting energy level

Each round, or tick, each "chance" in the characteristics is simulated in this order:
    - Each predator has 1 energy removed
    - An amount of energy is given to each prey
    - Each prey and predator has a chance to reproduce
    - Each predator attempts to "kill" a prey
    - Each organism has a chance of a spontaneous death

ENERGY LEVEL
    Each predator requires a minimum energy level to survive, this is to simulate starvation and death if the 
    predator's genome dictates that it is not very good at killing prey
    Each prey requires a minimum energy level to survive, this is to stop over-reproduction
    Each prey is created with a starting energy level. A proportion of this is absorbed by the predator when it
    eats the prey. This is to simulate a predator adapting to eat a certain type of food
    Every tick, there is an amount of energy given to each prey. This is to simulate the photosynthesis/sunlight
    energy absorbed

REPRODUCTION
    Each predator and prey reproduces asexually, and the chance is determined by its genome dictating the 
    reproduction chance. It takes 1 energy from a predator and prey to reproduce. This is to see if any of the 
    predators evolve to reproduce at an optimal level to not use all their energy whilst maintaining the 
    population.
    Each reproduction has a chance to produce 1-5 offspring, this is determined by the genome
    Each reproduction has a chance of mutation

HUNTING
    Each tick, each predator has a chance to kill 1 prey, which has the chance to defend it. If the prey defends it,
    the predator does not die, but does not get any more energy that round. If there are more predators than prey,
    then surplus predators will have a chance to attack other prey, and a chance to not attack anything. This is to 
    hopefully simulate the rise and fall of populations of predator and prey

SPONTANEOUS DEATH
    Each tick, each predator and prey has a chance of spontaneous death, this is to simulate deaths unrelated to a 
    predator/prey relationship such as a forest fire, or the more trivial falling off a cliff
